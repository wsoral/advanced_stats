# Homework 4 - predicting average grade

## Deadline - May 2nd, 2017

According to some theories of personality (e.g. Mischel, Shoda, Rodriguez, 1989) self-control can play decisive role in individual's
achievements (better performance at school, better job). Some researchers argue that self-control can be even more important than
individual's inteligence.

The topic is highly controversial, and no single study can bring a decisive evidence in favor of either inteligence or self-control.
However, we can try and learn how to analyze example data comming from one of such studies. We will use multiple regression analysis here.

A total of N=300 participants took part in this study. They completed inteligence test, and self-control scale.
Their average grade during last year of study was independently recorded.

1. Open dataset - home4.sav.
2. Perform multiple regression - with average grade as outcome variable, and intelligence and self-control as predictors.
a. Adjust your model for additional covariates - gender and year of study.
b. Check assumptions of the multiple regression. Note if there are any suspicious results.
c. Check the overall model quality - goodness of fit.
d. Check whether inteligence and self-control are significant predictors of average grade.
e. Try to assess which of the two is more important predictor of average grade.
3. Write up your results.
a. Remember about proper structure and formatting. Do not exceed 3 pages (Times New Romes, 12 points, double spacing)
b. Your structure should have: Aim of the analysis, Method, Results, and short Discussion
c. Include either simple plot or regression table, but remeber about proper formatting.
