#SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES RELATED TO HOME ASSIGNMENTS

##How your home assignments should look like?

Most of the home assignments will consist of writing short statistical reports. These should be no more than 3 pages of length (including tables, figures, and references). The reports should be formatted in strict APA style (6th version) and should include following sections:

1. Aim of the analyses. Up to two or three sentences of theoretical justification. Main questions and hypotheses.
2. Method. Short description (a paragraph) of study procedure and measures. Please consult any APA journal (e.g. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology) for an example of how to do that part, but most of all try to be concise.
3. Results. Statistical approach taken (e.g. ANOVA or multiple regression). What was dependent (outcome) variable, what were the independent variables (predictors). What were the main results, and did they confirm the hypotheses (if applicable). What was unexpected or against the hypotheses.
4. Conclusions, limitations of the analyses, possible steps in future studies.
5. References (if any).

##Exporting SPSS tables

You should NEVER copy and paste the whole SPSS output to your paper. Usually one table will suffice, and often you will not need any of them. You will learn which one to choose during this course. In general, most people agree that SPSS tables are nightmare. They include too much information and unnecessarily confuse most users. Although we have made some tweaks that make SPSS tables resemble APA tables, there is still some work to do. When writing your paper always consult the newest (6th) version of APA manual and format your tables according to instructions.

When you really feel that you should copy a table from SPSS, the best way to do this is probably by exporting a separate .doc file. Right-click on a table, and then select Export… . Make sure that Selected option is checked in Objects to Export field. Next in Document > Type select Word/RTF (\*.doc). In File Name enter desired destination of a file. Click OK. You can then edit the table in MS Word or some open-source alternative (I am afraid that Apple Pages will not work in this case).


##Saving a high quality figure in SPSS

A raster graphic (e.g. bmp, jpeg, png, tiff) is an image made of hundreds of tiny squares of colour information, referred to as either pixels or dots. SPSS by default displays figures and charts as raster graphics and has a major drawback - user cannot configure the figure resolution and the default one is quite small. This frequently results in blurry images (especially when enlarged) that do not meet the standards of professional journals (editors usually require the resolution of at least 300 DPI).

One solution is using vector images. A vector graphic (pdf, eps) uses math to draw shapes using points, lines and curves. Vector graphics are infinitely scalable, they have smaller file size, and are easy to edit in software such us Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape. Vector graphics are usually accepted by professional journals and if not, they are easy to convert to raster graphics with satisfactory resolution.

In SPSS you can easily export your chart to a vector image. Right-click on a chart, and then select Export… . Make sure that Selected option is checked in Objects to Export field. Next in Document > Type select None (Graphics only). Below in Graphics > Type select Encapsulated Postscript (\*.eps) or Enhanced Metafile (\*.emf, if you are using MS Office). In Root File Name enter desired destination of a file. Click OK.

If your are using LibreOffice or Apple Pages you should be able to import .eps file to your paper. If you are using MS Word, you should import .emf file to your paper .

IMPORTANT NOTE! When writing your home assignments or any papers, please make sure that your figures look good, have nice resolution, and all the labels and annotations have proper size (at least 10 points when inserted into manuscript).
