## Dataset: home7.sav

The data consist of list of 21 traits (positive and negative) that were presented to N=160 Polish participants.
Each participant had assess whether a trait is typical to Poles in general or not.
The task is to reduce the list of traits to smaller number of dimensions using factor analysis.

1. Check whether variables correlate with each other, and the correlation matrix is not too diffused. Report proper statistics.
2. Check for singularity of the correlation matrix.
3. Check measures of sampling adequacy for each of the variables.
4. Perform factor analysis, and analyze the scree plot to select a proper number of dimensions.
5. Perform factor analysis with selected number of dimensions. Use varimax rotation.
6. Write up the results. Make to report a table with factor loadings. You can sort the traits, and filter values lower than 0.3.
