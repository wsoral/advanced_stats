# Homework 1 - what is wrong with this data?

## Deadline February 28, 2017

Before attempting to analyze your data and verify your hypotheses, you should always carefully check the data quality. In practice, you will probably spend about 80% of your time on checking the integrity of your data and data-munging (i.e. making necessary corrections, like transformations) and only 20% on statistical analyses.

To complete this assignment you should first read/review 2 chapters from Andy Field textbook "Discovering Statistics using SPSS":
* Exploring data with graphs
* Exploring assumptions

Moreover read a paper on tidy data by Hadley Wickham (you can find it in lab_texts folder of this repository).

Download a dataset *home1.sav* from the current folder. In the dataset you will find (artificial) results of some experiment, stored in variables x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, and x6.
On the basis of the literature and information that you obtained during the lab, try to answer what is wrong which each variable. Why you should be careful when comparing these variables between two conditions?

Explain the case of each variable (x1 to x6), and propose some solution to manage the problem (if it is obvious). Illustrate with proper graphs if necessary.

In this assignment you do not have to write full report. However, try to stick to APA style.
