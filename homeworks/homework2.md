# Homework 2 - Watching movies

## Deadline March 14, 2017

Open in SPSS a dataset named home2.sav.
These are data from study conducted in the Personality, Motivation and Cognition Laboratory at Northwestern University. 

### Study methodology:
Subjects were randomly assigned to one of four movie conditions: 
  1. Frontline. A documentary about the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. 
  2. Halloween. A horror film. 
  3. National Geographic, a nature film about the Serengeti plain. 
  4. Parenthood. A comedy. 
  
Each film clip was shown for 9 minutes. Following this the Motivational State Questionnaire (MSQ) was given.

Data from the MSQ were scored for Energetic and Tense Arousal (EA and TA) as well as Positive and Negative Affect (PA and NA).

### Task: 

Choose 2 dependent variables: either EA and TA or PA and NA. Write short report that answers how watching different types of movies influences affect related variables.

1. Rember about a proper structure of the report and try to be concise (your report should be no longer that 3 pages of APA manuscript).
2. Try to make predictions about how the group means should look like, relative to each other, and use planned contrast to verify your prediction.
3. After checking your predictions, and if overall F-value for the test is significant, look for unexpected differences (use post-hoc).
4. Illustrate your results with one graph (remember about proper format).

*Hint 1*: You can always consult Andy Field book if you get stuck and don't know how to perform some of the analyses.

*Hint 2*: Open any good APA journal, like Journal of Personality and Social Psychology or Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,
and try to understand the way the empirical part of articles in such journal is written (how results of similar experimental study are reported).
