# Resources for Advanced Statistical Methods
##Here you will find resources that will help mastering the material during the lab "Advanced Statistical Methods".
More specifically you will find here:

1. datasets that we will use during lab exercises
2. homework assignments and datasets required for completion
3. lab presentations
3. some additional literature
4. useful resources - helpful during a course

You can view and download the resources from this website, or you can start using Git and sync the content
of this repository with a folder on your PC or laptop within a few seconds.

You can learn how to install Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
After successful installation just clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wsoral/advanced_stats
```
After some time some changes will be made on this repository. You can just pull these changes, by simply going to the folder on your PC and:
```bash
git pull
```

Occasionally in lab notes you will find in some R snippets (e.g. see lab presentation for the first lesson). Using R would drastically increase a level of difficulty of this lab, so I will not require nor teach about it, we will stick with SPSS. However, you are free (or even encouraged) to try R. Most lab computers should have some R installation. You can also install it for free from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/). Just copy and paste the code into the R console and it should work.
